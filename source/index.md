## üë®‚Äçüíª  Technologies & skills
I love **PHP**. Actually, started tinkering with PHP quite a few years ago. Sometimes around 2012. Since then, never looked back. Started doing it professionally in 2015, when I had some freelance projects.

The major part of my PHP career, I've spent with **Laravel**. Such a fantastic framework for someone who wants to get stuff done rather quickly and in a clean way. Of course, it goes
without needing to say this, but **Symfony** components are daily in my life.

After PHP, my love is definitely JavaScript. To be *precise* **TypeScript**. I love strongly-typed languages and TypeScript is the best in class. 
When it comes to the JavaScript world, my goto is definitely **Vue.js**.

**Tailwind CSS**. It's such an awesome library. Started using it in alpha, before the first stable release and never looked back.

**Docker**. I *love* componentization & separation. I prefer my code to be separated and do one thing, and do it well. The same goes with my development environment.
It's such a pleasure when you can have multiple PHP versions, database servers and they never collide with your host OS and don't block, nor break upgrades.

.. and of course **GNU/Linux**.. or just **Linux** is my daily driver. I've started using it as a primary development platform when I started my career
professionally and pretty much never looked back. Back in 2019, I hopped on Microsoft's WSL (version 1) and I really liked it. WSL2 was even better, but in the end, I just
installed Linux natively on my machine and kept using it like that. I was always mixing between Ubuntu and Fedora. Currently daily driving Fedora.
