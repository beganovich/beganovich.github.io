<h2>👨‍💻  Technologies &amp; skills</h2>

<p>I love <strong>PHP</strong>. Actually, started tinkering with PHP quite a few years ago. Sometimes around 2012. Since then, never looked back. Started doing it professionally in 2015, when I had some freelance projects.</p>

<p>The major part of my PHP career, I've spent with <strong>Laravel</strong>. Such a fantastic framework for someone who wants to get stuff done rather quickly and in a clean way. Of course, it goes
without needing to say this, but <strong>Symfony</strong> components are daily in my life.</p>

<p>After PHP, my love is definitely JavaScript. To be <em>precise</em> <strong>TypeScript</strong>. I love strongly-typed languages and TypeScript is the best in class. 
When it comes to the JavaScript world, my goto is definitely <strong>Vue.js</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. It's such an awesome library. Started using it in alpha, before the first stable release and never looked back.</p>

<p><strong>Docker</strong>. I <em>love</em> componentization &amp; separation. I prefer my code to be separated and do one thing, and do it well. The same goes with my development environment.
It's such a pleasure when you can have multiple PHP versions, database servers and they never collide with your host OS and don't block, nor break upgrades.</p>

<p>.. and of course <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>.. or just <strong>Linux</strong> is my daily driver. I've started using it as a primary development platform when I started my career
professionally and pretty much never looked back. Back in 2019, I hopped on Microsoft's WSL (version 1) and I really liked it. WSL2 was even better, but in the end, I just
installed Linux natively on my machine and kept using it like that. I was always mixing between Ubuntu and Fedora. Currently daily driving Fedora.</p>
